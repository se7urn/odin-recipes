    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>This overnight breakfast casserole is just the right size for smaller families.</p> We love this with cherry tomatoes, but it is equally nice with fruit. You could also call this a savory bread pudding and serve it for lunch, with a salad. If you love mustard, double the Dijon amount in the recipe.
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>butter-flavored cooking spray</li>
        <li>2 large croissants</li>
        <li>½ cup shredded Gruyere cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup diced cooked ham</li>
        <li>6 large eggs</li>
        <li>¾ cup milk</li>
        <li>½ cup sour cream</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped green onions (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Recipe Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <p>Step 1</p>
        Spray an 8x8-inch baking pan with cooking spray.
        <p>Step 2</p>
        Cut croissants into 1 inch cubes (about 4 cups, loosely packed) and spread out on the bottom of the prepared pan. Sprinkle evenly with cheese and ham.
        <p>Step 3</p>
        Combine eggs, milk, sour cream, Dijon mustard, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Beat the mixture until well blended using a wire whisk or an egg beater.
        <p>Step 4</p>
        Pour egg mixture evenly over the top of the croissants, cheese, and ham.
        <p>Step 5</p>
        Cover tightly with aluminum foil and place in the refrigerator for 8 hours.
        <p>Step 6</p>
        When ready to bake, set the dish out of the refrigerator on the counter, Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
        <p>Step 7</p>
        Uncover casserole, place in the center of the preheated oven, and bake until the casserole is set, and a knife inserted into the middle of the casserole comes out clean, 45 to 55 minutes.
        <p>Step 8</p>
        Cut into serving pieces and garnish with chopped green onions.

        <h3>Cook's Note</h3>
        If you'd like to make this for a crowd, simply double the ingredients and use a 9x13-inch baking dish. You may need to adjust the cooking time.
