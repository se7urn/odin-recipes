        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>These baked meatballs are tender and tasty. I also freeze these meatballs and take out how many servings I need for each meal.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup Italian-seasoned bread crumbs</li>
            <li>¼ cup grated Romano cheese</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>½ cup water</li>
            <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>1 ½ pounds ground beef</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Recipe Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix the bread crumbs, cheese, parsley, and seasonings together.</li>
            <li>Stir in the water and eggs, then add the ground beef.</li>
            <li>Form the mixture into balls and place them on a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake the meatballs until cooked through and evenly browned.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Tip: </strong>If serving in sauce, add baked meatballs 20 minutes before serving time.</p>
        <p><strong>How Long to Bake Meatballs?</strong></p>
        In an oven preheated to 350 degrees F, these meatballs should be fully cooked through and evenly browned in about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the middle of the meatball should read at least 165 degrees F.
        <p><strong>How to Store Baked Meatballs</strong></p>
        Store your leftover baked meatballs in a shallow, airtight container in the refrigerator for up to four days.
        <p><strong>Can You Freeze Baked Meatballs?</strong></p>
        Yes! These baked meatballs freeze well. Flash freeze the cooked meatballs on a baking sheet for a few hours or up to overnight, then transfer the frozen meatballs to a freezer-safe container. Freeze for up to three months.
        If you like, you can also freeze the meatballs before cooking. Cook them from-frozen on the stove whenever you want to whip up a quick dish.
